# first commit

# Here are some of the concepts for particle system:
# • Developing a mathematical model for a fountain particle system
# • Using GPU shaders for computation
# • Using textures and billboarding to imitate complex 3D objects
# • Using OpenGL rendering features such as blending, depth masks, and alpha channels to draw semitransparent objects
# • Using a camera model to draw 3D perspective views
